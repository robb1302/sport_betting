# Predicting Sports Events
This project is focused on predicting the outcome of upcoming sports events, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the winner of a given event, based on historical data and other relevant factors.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data
- scripts
src
- data/: Contains raw and processed data files.
- features/: Contains feature engineering code.
- models/: Contains trained models and code for training and evaluation.
- utils/: Contains helper functions and classes.
- visualisation/: Contains code for visualising data and model output.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software installed on your system:

Python 3.8
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Place the raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
Run the feature engineering code in features/ to process the data and create features.
Train a model using the code in models/, and save the trained model to models/.
Run the prediction code in models/ to make predictions on new data.
Use the code in visualisation/ to create visualisations of the model output.
